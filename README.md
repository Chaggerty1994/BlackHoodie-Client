# Black Hoodies - Online store for concept youth fashion brand



### My Goals in building this project were :
  
  - To Design an online store in Figma that was minimal, accesible, and displayed a very clear brand identity
  - To use React, and Material UI to build the website true to its original design and be fully functional
  - To use and gain a deeper understanding of CSS grid and Material UI's image list components
  - Build a functioning API with Python / Django to manage the data and requests for the application 
  - gain a deeper understanding of and properly execute many to many relationships with my database
